Azure policies come into play to enforce these organizational policies at Management Group, Subscription and resource groups level. For example, your company wants to ensure that all your azure resources reside in one of the preselected location, and users are not allowed to create resources outside these locations. Azure Policy makes it possible by enforcing location setting across Management Group / Subscription/ resource groups.</description>

      <description>Terraform Introduction Infrastructure as code, popularly known as IaC, adopted by industry through DevOps, the key reason being source code would always generate the same result. Infrastructure as code evolved to solve the problem of environment drift in the release pipelines. Inconsistency among environments leads to issues during deployments. Without IaC, administration and infrastructure maintenance involves manual processes that are hard to track and contributed to errors.
The most popular tools used for Iac are Azure ARM and Terraform.</description>
