      <description>Azure Policy All architecture designs are driven by set of rules to meet regulatory and security compliances. Azure policies come into play to enforce these organizational policies at Management Group, Subscription and resource groups level.

Azure Policy makes it possible by enforcing location setting across Management Group / Subscription/ resource groups.</description>
